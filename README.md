# Save-The-Seas

## What is Save The Seas?

Save the seas is a charity that is dedicated to the conservation of sea life and our oceans.
The Goals of the website in order of importance:

1. Promote awareness of the need to protect the oceans and educate people on sea life. This is the most important because the charity believe spreading awareness is most important as it will inspire more people to help in anyway they can, even if its not through donating. Also someone who is inspired is more likley to continue helping in the future rather than just a one off donation. 
2. Get people to donate to the charity. Getting donations is the next most important goal of the website as money helps. A donation is the easiest way for people to help the charity and what the majority of people are expected to do when they come onto the website.
3. Tell people about previouse fund raisers the charity has put on. This is not as important as the other two goals for the charity because it doesn't directly help the cause but it does showcase the charities previouse work which they are proud of and want to show off.

 This Website is the best way to do this as the internet is clearly the new way to advertise products, buisnesses, ideas and easily share them around via social media which is want Save the Seas want to spread awareness of Sea life. As this website will have a modile first aproach this will help with the shareability of the website.
